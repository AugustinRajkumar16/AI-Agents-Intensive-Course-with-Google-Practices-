    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **AI for Protein Structure Prediction and Engineering.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's dive deeper into what this means and why it's such a significant breakthrough in drug discovery:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Fundamental Importance of Protein Structure:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Proteins are the workhorses of our cells. They perform a vast array of functions:\n",
      "*   **Enzymes:** Catalyzing biochemical reactions.\n",
      "*   **Antibodies:** Fighting off infections.\n",
      "*   **Receptors:** Signaling between cells.\n",
      "*   **Structural Components:** Providing shape and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way a protein works is intimately linked to its **three-dimensional (3D) structure**. Think of it like a lock and key. A drug molecule is often designed to fit into a specific \"pocket\" or site on a protein (the lock) to either activate it, block its activity, or modify its function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Historical Challenge:**\n",
      "\n",
      "For decades, determining the 3D structure of a protein was an incredibly difficult, time-consuming, and expensive process. It typically involved:\n",
      "*   **Crystallography:** Growing high-quality protein crystals and then using X-ray diffraction to deduce the structure. This is often not possible for many proteins.\n",
      "*   **NMR Spectroscopy:** Using magnetic fields to determine the structure, which is also complex and has limitations.\n",
      "*   **Cryo-EM (Cryo-Electron Microscopy):** A more recent technique that has improved greatly but still requires significant expertise and equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "These methods could take years and weren't always successful for all proteins, especially smaller or more flexible ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing This:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI, particularly deep learning, has changed the game in protein structure prediction. The most prominent example is **AlphaFold**, developed by DeepMind (Google).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **AlphaFold's Breakthrough:** AlphaFold uses deep learning to predict the 3D coordinates of amino acids in a protein chain based solely on its amino acid sequence. It has achieved accuracy levels that are comparable to experimental methods for many proteins.\n",
      "*   **How it Works (Simplified):** It learns from a massive dataset of known protein structures and sequences. It uses sophisticated algorithms to infer the physical and evolutionary constraints that dictate how a protein folds into its specific shape. It's like training a super-intelligent AI to understand the rules of molecular self-assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact on Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Accelerated Target Identification:**\n",
      "    *   **Knowing the \"Lock\":** Before, identifying a protein target for a drug meant spending significant time and resources determining its structure. Now, researchers can quickly get a highly accurate predicted structure for potentially thousands of disease-related proteins.\n",
      "    *   **Unlocking Previously \"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many disease-causing proteins have been difficult to drug because their structures were unknown or weren't amenable to traditional drug design. AI-predicted structures are making these targets accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **More Precise Drug Design:**\n",
      "    *   **\"In Silico\" Screening:** With a known 3D structure, researchers can use computational tools to virtually screen libraries of drug-like molecules to see which ones might bind to the target protein's active site.\n",
      "    *   **Rational Drug Design:** Instead of trial-and-error, drug designers can use the predicted structure to rationally design molecules that fit perfectly into the binding pocket, maximizing efficacy and minimizing off-target effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Understanding Protein Function and Disease Mechanisms:**\n",
      "    *   **Identifying Functional Sites:** Predicted structures can reveal important functional regions on proteins, such as active sites, interaction interfaces, or regions involved in signaling.\n",
      "    *   **Investigating Mutations:** AI can help predict how genetic mutations might alter a protein's structure, leading to dysfunction and disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Protein Engineering:**\n",
      "    *   **Designing New Proteins:** Beyond just predicting existing structures, AI is being developed to *design* entirely new proteins with novel functions. This could lead to new enzymes for industrial processes, therapeutic proteins, or advanced biomaterials.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recent Developments and Trends:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Expanding Databases:** The release of millions of predicted protein structures (e.g., through the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database) has democratized access to this information, fueling research worldwide.\n",
      "*   **Next-Generation Models:** Researchers are building on AlphaFold's success, developing AI models that can predict protein complexes (how multiple proteins interact), protein dynamics (how they move), and the effects of mutations more accurately.\n",
      "*   **Integration with Other AI Tools:** Combining protein structure prediction with AI for drug molecule generation (as in development #1) creates powerful end-to-end drug discovery platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI for protein structure prediction has provided a foundational piece of information that was historically a bottleneck. By making accurate structural information readily available, it's dramatically accelerating the pace and improving the precision of drug discovery and development.\n",
